## Simple Calculator

Basic utility for evaluating expressions using +, -, \*, / operators

Fetches trivia from [numbers api](numbersapi.com) and displays on eval 

\* currently supports single digit operations only (lol) \*

### Why make this?

Following an abominable tech challenge performance involving the creation of a simple note taking app, I discovered I need lots of practice with basic front end development. 

Limited myself to HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS for the creation of this app.

\* following numbers api update, app now served with express to allow for server-side rendering of numbers api response (ejs also used for templating) \*

### How to run:

1. clone 
2. ```npm i```
3. ```npm start```
4. nav to localhost:8000/
