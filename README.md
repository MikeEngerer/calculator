### Why make this?

Following an abominable tech challenge performance involving the creation of a simple note taking app, I decided I needed some basic front-end practice. 

Limited myself to HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS for the creation of this app. \*

\* Implementing number trivia meant adding a minimal back-end (express) + view engine (ejs) for server side rendering 

### How to run:

1. ```git clone``` 
2. ```npm i```
3. ```npm start```
4. ```xdg-open http://localhost:8080```
5. Calculate!
